How are you currently using AI and their processes?
Although I don't actively reach out to LLM like ChatGPT, I have yet switched to a search engine that doesn't incorporate AI automatically.

What are the different approaches you might take in using AI in the future (if you will)?
In the future, I find that it's kind of inevitable to use AI so moving forward I will definitely be more specific in my prompts and make sure I seek out the best LLM to answer my question so that I refrain from generating more usage.

AI usage should be moderated by society, like it should be embarrassing to use it.
